# instruction_encode
Quick hack to show huffman-based length-limited instruction coding

It reads "instructions.json" and prints the resulting instruction
encoding to the screen. It's silly.

Note that I've put it with an MIT license but it contains some code
copied verbatim from "Data Compression with Rust", so the license
of that code (which I'm not sure about) overrules where applicable.
In other words, this is just a demo to show how things work, don't
really build on it.
